Split Testing
This feature is in BETA.

Netlifyâ€™s Split Testing lets you divide traffic to your site between different deploys, straight from our CDN network, without losing any download performance, and without installing any third party JavaScript library. You can use this for A/B testing, or for launching private beta releases.

You can use any client-side analytics library to track visitors across different versions of your site.
